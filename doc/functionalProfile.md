# Functional Profile

## General Concept

A functional profile contains a set of data points that support the implementation of a specific use case. It thereby
focuses entirely on the functionality. Any transport-specific details are not part of the functional profile (e.g.
on how to get or set a data point on a specific product).

The main intent is to allow communicator manufacturers to easily implement their use cases based on logically grouped data points, while device-specific communication details to the SGr communicator library. Any product that supports the functional profiles required for a specific use case is therefore  automatically compatible and can be used without changing the implementation.

The functional profiles are located on [library.smartgridready.ch](https://library.smartgridready.ch/FunctionalProfileTemplate).

## Structure 

A functional profile is structured into the following elements

- Definition of the functional profile with identification and description
- Data points defining access points to data of the product

### Definition

A functional profile is defined by

- the category of the functional profile defines the usage of the product (see [FunctionalProfileCategory](FunctionalProfileCategory.md))
- the type of the functional profile
- the level of operation (see [LevelOfOperation](LevelOfOperation.md))
- the version number

All these values must be used identically in the product to match a functional profile.

Additionally to this, the definition contains the description of a functional profile in English, German, French, and/or Italian language.

### Data Points

The data points define dynamic values that can be read from or written to the product.

Each data point is defined by

- a name to identify the data point
- a data direction defining whether the data can be
  - `R`: read
  - `W`: written
  - `WR`: read and written
- a presence level
  - `M`: mandatory - data point must be present in the product
  - `R`: recommended - data point should be present in the product
  - `O`: optional - data point can optionally be present in the product
- the data type of the data point
- the unit of the data point
- and a description of the data point

If a data point is defined as mandatory in the functional profile, it must also be present in the product implementing this functional profile.

If no data point is mandatory in the functional profile, then at least one data point must be recommended and at least one of the recommended data points must be present
in the product implementing this functional profile.

### Sub Data Points

Data Points that are connected to other data points can be modeled as sub data points.

The connection between data point and sub data point are defined with naming conventions. If e.g. a data point has the name "MainDatapoint" and is connected with a sub data point "SubDatapoint" the sub data point name has the name "MainDatapoint.SubDatapoint" - this means, the sub data point name is appended to the main data point name separated with a dot.

An example for a sub data point is "Voltage.Precision" as the precision of the data point "Voltage".

## Using Functional Profiles for declaration 

For the declaration of the a product the following flow is proposed:

- Fill in general information of the product like
  - device name
  - manufacturer name
  - device category
  - hardware and software version numbers
- Select the possible interface of the product (Modbus, RESTfulJSON, Contacts).
- Select the functional profiles from the [library](https://library.smartgridready.ch/FunctionalProfileTemplate) that should be implemented by the product.
- Copy the selected functional profiles into the product and add a name to the functional profile (with this it is possible to implement a
  functional profile more than once with different names).
- Add a description to the data point.

More information can be found on [smartgridready.ch](https://smartgridready.ch/deklaration/product-communicator).

# For developer - schema of functional profiles

## General Structure

The schema of the functional profile is structured on two levels:
- information concerning the entire functional profile
- a list of data points

The figure below shows the entity relation model of the functional profile

## Functional Profile Attributes

### Classification
SGr classifies and identifies any functional profile by the following values

| Element               | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| specificationOwnerIdentification          | identifier of the functional profile owner. |
| functionalProfileCategory | functional profile class (see [SGrFunctionalProfileCategory.xsd](../SchemaDatabase/SGr/Generic/BaseType_FunctionalProfileCategory.xsd) ) |
| functionalProfileType       | functional profile subclass |
| levelOfOperation   | level of control defining the complexity (see [LevelOfOperation](LevelOfOperation.md) ) |
| versionNumber         | version of the functional profile. Changes in primaryVersionNumber indicate breaking changes, changes in secondaryVersionNumber indicate complimentary changes, changes in subReleaseVersionNumber are without impact on the functionality | 

## Data Points
A functional profile mainly defines a set of data points. The attributes of a data point are defined in the next section.

# Data Point Attributes
| Element     | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| datapointName | name of the data point. Should be unique within the functional profile |
| dataDirection | `R` if data point can be read, `W` for write, `P` for persistence |
| presenceLevel | data point availability: Mandatory, Recommended, Optional |
| unit | physical unit of data point |
| dataType | data type of the value for the point type |
| alternativeNames | a list of relevant name spaces list for to display names used in different standards like EEBUS, IEC6850, SAREF4ENER etc. (see [AlternativeNames](AlternativeNames.md))|
| legibleDescription | optional, can occur once per language. Contains details concerning the intended use case of the functional profile. |

## New Functional Profiles

## File Naming Schema
Functional profiles should have the following file naming conventions:

`FP_[specificationOwnerIdentification]_[FunctionalProfileCategory]_[FunctionalProfileType]_[levelOfOperation]_[majorVerion].[minorVerion].xml`

## Writing Descriptions
Functional profile descriptions should be structured as follows:
- Image indicating the typical use of the functional profile, together with an easily understandable title
- Short explanation (i.e. long version of the title)
- Detailed explanation, including very attribute.
- Description on how to apply the functional profile concerning presence level (i.e. how to handle recommended and optional data points)

# Attachment
### Release Notes
The release note section contains meta data that describe history and current state of the functional profile

| Element   | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| state     | one of Draft, Review, Released, Revoked |
| remarks   | optional, arbitrary text. Can be useful e.g. during draft phase. |
| changeLog | optional, can occur multiple times. Contains release notes to the version concerned |

### Descriptions
| Element     | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| alternativeNames  | a list of relevant name spaces list for to display names used in different standards like EEBUS, IEC6850, SAREF4ENER etc. (see [AlternativeNames](AlternativeNames.md))|
| legibleDescription | optional, can occur multiple times, but ideally just a once per language. Contains details concerning the intended use case of the functional profile. |
