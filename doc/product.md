# Product Description Schema

## Use case

A product description contains information about the device, its supported functional profiles, and how
the data points of the functional profiles can be accessed through the communication interface.

This allows potential controllers to easily integrate, implement, or access any SmartGridready certified product
through a standardized set of functionalities, and thereby greatly simplifies scale-up to support a wide range of products.

## General Structure

The schema of the product description (EID, External interface definition) is structured on four levels:
- Device information concerning manufacturer and product data, and the basic configuration of the communication interface.
- A list of communication interfaces (e.g. Contacts, RESTfulJSon, Modbus, Messaging). Although it is in principle possible to define more than one communication interface in one product description if a device supports more than one type of communication, it is recommended to separate them into separate product descriptions.
- A list of supported functional profiles. The functional profiles must have the same content as those defined in the list of functional profiles. (see [Functional Profile Structure](functionalProfile.md), [List of Functional Profiles](https://library.smartgridready.ch/FunctionalProfileTemplate)).
- A list of data points (as defined in the respective functional profile definition) together with communication interface details defining how to access the individual data point.

The figure below shows the entity relation model of the product description.

### Configuration

Values in the product definition can contain place holders e.g. for IP addresses, device ID's, ...
These place holders are keys enclosed with double braces `{{}}`. The values for the keys must be provided during the instantiation of the product.

Example: `{{ipaddress}}`

The keys should be documented in a list of configuration items. Each item contains

| Element          | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| name             | key name |
| dataType         | the data type of this value|

|------------------|-------------|
| textElement      | description of the configuration item |
| language         | the language |
| label | short label to be displayed during the configuration of the device |

## Communication Interface

Although it is possible to define a list of communication interfaces for future use, it is strongly recommended to
define one product description for each communication interface the product supports.
(Also the current support libraries do not support multiple communication interfaces.)

Currently supported communication interfaces are

| Interface     | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| contactInterface | product with physical contacts | 
| restApiInterface | product with a RESTfulJSON interface | 
| modbusInterface | product with a Modbus interfacee |

Depending on the type of root element a transport-service specific structure is present, describing the device-specific communication interface configuration

### Contacts Communication Interface

The contacts interface has the following properties contained in a `contactInterfaceDescription`

| Element          | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| numberOfContacts      | number of contacts |

Usually, a product description with contacts is only for documentation, as the access to contacts from a communicator is not possible.

| firstRegisterAddressIsOne | Address of the first register |

The `serialInterfaceCapability` defines the possible values for the communication settings

| messageBrokerAuthentication | either `basicAuthentication` with `username` and `password` or `clientCertificateAuthentication` with `keystorePath`, `keystorePassword`, `truststorePath` and `truststorePassword` |

## Functional Profiles

Each device contains a list of functional profiles.

| Element     | Description |
|-------------|-------------|

## Data Points

Each functional profile instance contains a list of data points in accordance with the standardized functional profile.

A data point contains almost the same information as the data point within a [functional profile](functionalProfile.md#data-points).

| Element     | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| dataPointName | name of the data point (unique on functional profile) |
| dataDirection | a data direction defining whether the data can be `R` read,  `W` written, `WR` read and written, or whether the data is [`C` constant](#constant-data-points) |

| unitConversionMultiplicator | factor for converting the device value into the value of the generic unit |
| alternativeNames  | a list of relevant name spaces list for to display names used in different standards like EEBUS, IEC6850, SAREF4ENER etc. (see [AlternativeNames](AlternativeNames.md))|
(AlternativeNames.md) |

| programmerHints | additional device-specific implementation hints for this device |

Additionally to these attributes, the data point can have additional attributes corresponding to the communication interface - see below.

### Sub Data Points

Data Points that are defined as Sub Data Points are handled in the same way as the normal data points with all consequences. But a sub data point can only be used in the device if the main data point is also used.

### Constant Data Points

Additional to the data points in the functional profile the product has the concept of constant data points that can implement the data point of the functional profile and that have a constant value.

For this, the data direction `C` is possible in products. In this case, a value must be defined for the data point.

### Additional values for Contacts interface

There are no additional attributes for the contacts communication interface.

### Additional values for RESTfulJSon interface

Each RESTfulJSon data point requires additional information in a `restApiDataPointConfiguration` with

## Generic Attributes
SGr allows to associate attributes to a data point. See [GenericAttributes](GenericAttributes.md) for details.

The generic attributes (see [GenericAttributes](GenericAttributes.md)) contain static characteristics of the product.

The generic attributes are a list of elements defined by

- name
- data type
- value
- description

## File Naming Schema
File names for Products Definitions (EID's) should have the following file naming conventions:

`SGr_[LevelOfOperation]_[ManufacturerId]_[DesclarationId]_[Manufacturer]_[ProductName]_V[PrimaryVerion].[SecondaryVerion].xml`

with

- `LevelOfOperation`: as defined in [LevelOfOperation](LevelOfOperation.md) with 2 digits without `m` and with leading `0`
- `ManufacturerId`: maintained by the declaration office - `mmmm` if not yet known
- `DesclarationId`: maintained by the declaration office - `dddd` if not yet known
- `Manufacturer`: manufacturer name - short - if possible only one word
- `ProductName`: product name - short - if possible only one word
- `PrimaryVerion` / `SecondaryVerion`: first two parts of the version of the Product Definitions (EID's) - same as [versionNumber](product.md#device-attributes)

If there are more Product Definitions for one product with different interfaces, the interface can optionally be added as `Interface` with values `RestAPI`, `MQTT`, `Modbus`, `ModbusRTU`, `ModbusTCP`, ...

`SGr_[LevelOfOperation]_[ManufacturerId]_[DesclarationId]_[Manufacturer]_[ProductName]_[Interface]_V[PrimaryVerion].[SecondaryVerion].xml`
